If you have a search that you perform regularly you can make it a saved search.

Fore example maybe you want to see all articles about baseball that you haven't read yet. A good saved search for this might be something like `baseball is:unread sort:desc`.

To create a saved search:

1. Search for something
2. Press "Save" next to the search field
3. Give your saved search a title
4. Press "Save" in the dropdown
