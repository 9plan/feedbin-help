There are two ways to unsubscribe from a feed.

1. Select the feed in the main feed list and click delete in the bottom left corner of the screen.
2. Visit the Feeds page under Settings and check all the feeds you want to unsubscribe from. Then click unsubscribe at the bottom. This method is useful if you want to unsubscribe from a lot of feeds at once or reset your subscriptions list.
