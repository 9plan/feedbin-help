Great ideas can come from anywhere, so feature requests are an important part of improving any product.

A good way to make your feature request rise to the top is by putting a bit of effort into it.

1. Sell it! Why would this make a good feature?
2. Good features should appeal to many. Not just you.
3. How do you envision the feature would work? Use descriptions, mock-ups whatever helps communicate your vision.
4. Most of the time the hardest part of any feature is building an interface for it, so extra points if you can help out with that.
4. Above all contributing code is the best way to get a feature started.
